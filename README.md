# Game-Festival

This project was developed as part of the *Mobile Systems* course at the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.

The game was created using the Unity game engine.


In the game were created minigames:

**Fishing** - game where you can get 1 fish per 1 round. 

**Repeat the melody** - game where you click on frogs and repeat the music, after 3rd round you start getting +1 fish.


*There are 3 options of fish - grey (60%), green (30%), gold (10%)*

After you can sell this fish to pinguin and get some coins.

*Coins* you can use for buying skins in the *Shop* or playing card minigames with NPC.


**Poker** - game with dice, where you need to have better dice than your opponent.

**Find Pair** - game with cards, where you need to find the same cards in 2 minutes.

**More Less** - game with cards, where you need to say next card will be more or less than current, and win your opponent. 

**BlackJack** - game with cards, where you need to get 21 points (no more), and win your opponent.
